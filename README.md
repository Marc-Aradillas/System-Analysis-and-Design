# DriverPass System Project

# Project Scenario: 

The project is a scenario in which you are assigned as the System Analyst on the DriverPass Project:
"You work for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. Your project lead has assigned you to a new client, DriverPass. DriverPass noticed that there are very few tools that train students to pass their driving tests. Their research has found that more than 65% of the students applying for the driving license exam fail since all they did was study previous tests! DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants your help in designing a system that can handle these needs. The system has several stakeholders including IT, management, and customers."

"Your project lead has recently assigned you to take over as the systems analyst for the DriverPass project. She has asked you to complete a business requirements document that accurately captures DriverPassâ€™s needs. Your project lead would also like you to provide a brief analysis of both a process- and an object-modeling approach to designing this system."

# Project Goal:

Create UML Diagrams for the Driver pass System and Create a Presentation for a non-technical audience with appropriate wording and communication.
