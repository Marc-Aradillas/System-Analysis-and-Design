## Introduction

The DriverPass System project simulates a scenario where you, as a system analyst, design a system for a client named DriverPass. DriverPass aims to provide online practice exams and on-the-road training to help students prepare for their driving tests.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and communication of a system for DriverPass, achieved through:

* **Business Requirements Document:** Capturing DriverPass's needs and functionalities using a Word document.
* **System Design Document:** Detailing the system's technical specifications using UML diagrams created in Lucidchart.
* **Non-Technical Presentation:** Communicating the system's features and benefits to DriverPass in a clear and understandable manner using presentation slides.

## Deliverables

This project will deliver the following:

* **Business Requirements Document (Word Doc):** A comprehensive document outlining DriverPass's system requirements.
* **UML Diagrams (Lucidchart):** Visual representations of the system's structure and behavior.
* **Non-Technical Presentation (Slides):** A clear and concise presentation explaining the system to DriverPass stakeholders.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `Business Requirements Document.docx` file to understand DriverPass's needs.
3. Explore the `UML Diagrams` folder containing Lucidchart files representing the system design.
4. Review the `Presentation Slides.pptx` file for a clear explanation of the system aimed at a non-technical audience.

**Note:** Since this project focuses on non-technical aspects, the "Technical Details" section is omitted.
